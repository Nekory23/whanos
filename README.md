{EPITECH} | Third year | Advanced DevOps

DevOps is a collection of great notions and technologies that allows oneself to have a truly great control over the lifecycle of an application.
Mastering one notion or technology is like owning an Infinity Stone: you become very powerful.
Now, imagine owning several Infinity Stones at the same time, what a powerful programmer you would become!

This dream is about to come true. You have started your DevOps journey last year, and up to now, have collected 3 Infinity Stones:
• the Containerization Stone with Docker;
• The Automation Stone with Jenkins;
• The Orchestration Stone with Kubernetes.

You started your journey with Moby Dock, the Docker whale.

And you are going to finish it with another one, very knowledgeable about Infinity Stones: Whanos.
